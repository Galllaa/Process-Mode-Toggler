While prototyping, I often disable nodes using the "Process Mode" selection. However, it can get tedious to scroll and search for the "Disabled" mode repeatedly. To make this easier, I created this plugin!

This plugin adds a convenient button to the upper-right corner of the Godot editor, allowing you to quickly toggle the "Disabled" mode without the hassle.
